How does vanilla JS works? I explain in depth

In this project, I created a website that explains 8 core concepts of JavaScript that I believe are some of the most important. These are:

1. JavaScript and the DOM
2. JavaScript prototypes
3. How the JavaScript Engine works
4. Asynchronous vs Synchronous code
5. HTTP Requests and the REST API
6. Event Handlers
7. Promises and async/await
8. Unit testing, integration testing, and end to end testing in JavaScript

All 8 of these concepts are covered in depth, and I used this as an opportunity to both improve my HTML/CSS and vanilla JavaScript skills and to reinforce
these key ideas so I can understand and explain them more comprehensively.
