          Prototypes, Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Objects in JavaScript
        </h1>
        <h2>Before We Get Started...</h2>
        <p class="text">
          In this section, we will do a review of 4 JavaScript concepts that are
          at the core of JavaScript programming. Objects are the most basic, so
          we will cover them first. Then, we will look at prototypes, and learn
          how they play an instrumental part in inheritance. Finally, we will go
          over encapsulation, which is a critical part of writing secure
          JavaScript applications, making sure sensitive data is not exposed to
          the public.
        </p>
        <h2>Objects</h2>
        <p class="text">
          In JavaScript, every non-primitive is an object. All objects are
          essentially a collection of related data, and can also contain related
          functionality. The first object below is an object literal with 4
          properties and no functionality. The second is a non-literal that
          invokes the empty constructor.
        </p>

        <pre>
  <code class="code">
    const family = {
      father: "John", 
      mother: "Sarah", 
      son: "Stephen",
      daughter: "Gia"
    };
  </code>
  <code class="code">
    const date = new Date();
  </code> 
        </pre>
        <p class="text">
          Both these statements create objects, but do so in different ways.
          Looking at the second object, it is created using the
          <code>new</code> keyword. This means that a <em>constructor</em> was
          invoked, and we created a class. Classes are very important for both
          prototypes and inheritance. If you do not know what a class is,
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Classes_in_JavaScript"
            target="_blank"
            >click here</a
          >
          for a good explanation. In short, classes are <em>templates</em> for
          objects. They allow us to group related data better than using a
          conventional object. They are instantiated with a constructor, and
          contain methods and properties that operate on that class.
        </p>
        <h2>Prototypes</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Every object has a prototype. But what is a prototype? A prototype is
          just an object, and every prototype also has its own prototype.
          JavaScript will keep searching prototype's prototypes until reaching
          an object where the prototype is null. This creates something known as
          the <strong>prototype chain</strong>. When an object does not possess
          a method called on it, its prototype is then searched for that method,
          and JavaScript continues up the prototype chain until either finding
          the method or throwing an error. In the case of the object literal
          <code>family</code>, there are no methods to be called, so every
          method called on it will be searched for on its prototype. The
          prototype of an object literal will always be
          <strong>Object { }</strong>. You can verify this by using the method
          <code>Object.getPrototypeOf(family)</code>. The prototype of any
          non-literal object is written as the object<em>.prototype</em>. For
          <strong>Object</strong>, it is <em>Object.prototype</em>. One method
          that can be called on any literal or non-literal object is the
          <code>toString()</code> method. The reason it is available to all
          objects is because it is part of Object.prototype, and
          Object.prototype's prototype is null, meaning it is at the end of the
          prototype chain. When <code>toString()</code> is called on the
          <code>family</code> object, JavaScript sees that there is no matching
          method, so it looks at the prototype of <code>family</code>, and finds
          the method there. For the second object we defined above, it is a
          non-literal object, so it may have its own prototype, and in this case
          it does. The prototype of <code>date</code> is the
          <code>Date.prototype</code> object, and the
          <code>Date.prototype</code> prototype is
          <code>Object.prototype</code>. Accessing undefined methods in an
          object by searching for them in its prototype is the basis of how a
          concept known as <strong>inheritance</strong> works, which we will go
          into further detail on next.
        </p>
        <h2>Inheritance</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Inheritance is one of the most important topics in OOP. It differs a
          bit between languages, but in JavaScript, it is the process by which
          an object can obtain methods that are not explicitely declared inside
          itself. All methods found on the prototype chain above that object are
          available to that object. Suppose we have this class Animal:
        </p>
        <pre>
  <code class="code">
    class Animal {
      constructor(phylum) {
        this.phylum = phylum;
      }
      function getPhylum() {
        return this.phylum;
      }
    }
  </code>
  <code class="code">
    class Mammal extends Animal {
      constructor(phylum, species) {
        super(phylum);
        this.species = species;
      }
      function mnemonic() {
        return `A ${this.species} comes from the Animal Kingdom, ${this.getPhylum()} phylum, and the Mammalia class`;
      }
    }
  </code>
</pre>
        <p class="text">
          As can be seen above, the <code>Mammal</code> class
          <em>inherits</em> the <code>getPhylum()</code> method from the
          <code>Animal</code> class by using the <code>extends</code> keyword.
          That method is not inherently available to the
          <code>Mammal</code> class, but is accessible through class
          inheritance. Class inheritance is using prototypes behind the scenes,
          and if the <code>getPhylum()</code> method did not exist in
          <code>Animal</code>, an error would be thrown. What's more is that we
          can add more classes to this (for example, adding a
          <code>Tiger</code> class that extends <code>Mammal</code>), which is
          what creates the <em>prototype chain</em>. For the prototype chain to
          function correctly, a <code>subclass</code> (the class that is
          inheriting) can only extend a single
          <strong>parent class/base class</strong> (the class that is being
          inherited from). This way we have a prototype chain and not a
          prototype web! As a side note, all classes farther up the chain from a
          subclass are also parent classes to that subclass, because the
          subclass is also inheriting from them, although it isn't explicit in
          the code.
        </p>
        <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
        <p class="text">
          The last topic I want to cover here is encapsulation. In other OOP
          languages like Java, you are able to declare a variable as
          <code>private</code>, which restricts the visibility of that variable
          to just the class it resides in. However, JavaScript did not have this
          capability until recently, so we will cover how it is done now and how
          it was done previously. ES6 introduced classes into JavaScript, and
          with classes, encapsulation becomes easier. Take a class
          <strong>Person</strong>:
        </p>
        <pre>
  <code class="code">
    class Person {
      constructor(name, dob, ssn) {
        this.name = name;
        this.dob = dob;
        this.ssn = ssn;
      }
      //getters and setters
    }
    const person = new Person("Sean", "01/01/2000", "000-00-0000");
  </code>
</pre>
        <p class="text">
          This seems very unsafe. At the moment, all someone needs to do is call
          <code>console.log(person)</code> and everything is visible. Now look
          at this:
        </p>
        <pre>
  <code class="code">
    class Person {
      constructor(name, dob, ssn) {
        let _name = name;
        let _dob = dob;
        let _ssn = ssn;
        this.getName = () => _name;
        this.getDob = () -> _dob;
        this.getSsn = () -> _ssn;
        this.setDob = (d) -> _dob = d;
        this.setSsn = (s) -> _ssn = s;
      }
    }
    let person = new Person("Sean", "01/01/2000", "000-00-0000");
  </code>
        </pre>
        <p class="text">
          Now, this seems much more secure. We are never using the
          <code>this</code> keyword on the values. Instead, we add functions as
          properties, masking the values of the inputs and making it so the
          class itself never actually registers the values going into the
          constructor. To update the DOB for example, we would write
          <code>person.setDob("03/23/1995")</code>. If we
          <code>console.log()</code>, we no longer get any data about the
          person's name, DOB or SSN, which is good, because that should always
          be kept private. If you want to learn more about how encapsulation was
          done before ES6 came out, keep reading below, else move onto the next
          section!
        </p>
        <h4>Encapsulation pre-ES6</h4>
        <p class="text">
          To achieve encapsulation in JavaScript pre-ES6, a concept known as
          <strong>closures</strong> was used. A closure is the combination of a
          function grouped with references to its surrounding state. Using the
          class above, but in the form of an object, we can see this would
          immediately be a problem:
          <code class="code"
            >const person = {name: "Sean", dob: "01/01/2000", ssn:
            "000-000-0000}"</code
          >. Right now, we could just do
          <code>person.ssn = "111-222-3333"</code>, and now Sean is a whole
          other person! This is super unsafe, and restricting visibility of
          sensitive data is a must. Restricting visibility could be done by
          using a function. All local variables are not accessible from the
          outside, so we could do something like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
  <code class="code">
    function person() {
      var name = "Sean";
      var dob = "01/01/2000";
      var ssn = "000-000-0000";
      //logic for setting and getting
      return ??????;
    }
  </code>
        </pre>
        <p class="text">
          This seems like a good first step, but now how do we retrieve these
          variables? A return statement can only take a single value, and we
          need to return 3. This seems like a good place to put an object, but
          then we're back to step 1, because someone could just call
          <code>person().ssn = "..."</code> again. This is where closures come
          in. Look at the difference between the first code example and the one
          below:
        </p>
        <pre>
  <code class="code">
    function person() {
      var name = "Sean";
      var dob = "01/01/2000";
      var ssn = "000-000-0000";
      var updateObj = {
        getName: function() {
          return name;
        }
        getDOB: function() {
          return dob;
        }
        setDOB: function(newDOB) {
          dob = newDOB;
        }
        getSSN: function() {
          return ssn;
        }
        setSSN: function(newSSN) {
          ssn = newSSN
        }
      }
      return updateObj;
    }
  </code>
        </pre>
        <p class="text">
          The second code example does something a little wonky. It is still
          returning an object, which we said would be the right way to go, but
          instead of having fields for name, dob, and ssn, it has fields for
          setter and getter functions. This seems kind of similar to how ES6
          implemented class encapsulation, but with a few extra steps involved.
          Now, data is fully hidden from anybody looking to access it through a
          <code>console.log()</code>. Since ES6 is what is currently used, this
          is mostly just for background knowledge, but you may find some corner
          case where it is better to use closures than class encapsulation. I
          hope you found this useful, and see you in the next section!
