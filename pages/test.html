        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p class="text">
          In this section, we will cover unit testing, how to write unit tests
          using the Jest testing library, integration testing, and end to end
          testing. We will also cover when it is best to use each one. Let's get
          started!
        </p>
        <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
        <p class="text">
          First off, we need to define what unit testing is.
          <strong>Unit testing</strong> is the process of writing test cases for
          individual components of a product. It separates each component into
          its own environment by simulating dependencies using a technique
          called <em>mocking</em>. Mocking is very useful for complex code with
          a lot of dependencies, because the developer can control the output.
          If we are unit testing a function <code>foo</code>, and there is
          another function inside <code>foo</code>, we mock the inner function
          to output what we want it to output, and see how the rest of
          <code>foo</code> reacts. If the function we are testing never checks
          if the inner function returns null, then we could break our code if it
          did return null. Unit testing and mocking together are extremely
          important skills in tech today, and are used in almost every project
          built today. Next, we will go over one of the most popular libraries
          for writing unit tests in JavaScript, known as <strong>Jest</strong>.
        </p>
        <h3>Jest</h3>
        <p class="text">
          Jest is a very popular unit testing framework. It is used
          predominantly for testing React, but can also be used for testing
          Angular and of course vanilla JavaScript. Although we will be going
          over Jest here, since it is the most popular, most of these concepts
          carry over to other testing frameworks as well. When writing unit
          tests in Jest, we use a concept called <em>matchers</em>. The syntax
          for a matcher is <code>expect(a).toBe(b)</code> where a and b are
          exactly equivalent. This matcher is used for primitives, since exact
          equivalence is easy to adhere to. For non-primitives, including
          objects, arrays, etc, we use the
          <code>expect(obj}.toEqual({prop1: val1, prop2: val2})</code> matcher.
          <code>.toEqual()</code> recursively checks every field of an object or
          an array to ensure that they are equivalent and the result is correct.
          If we are trying to check that something is the opposite of the
          result, we can add <code>.not</code>, making the new matcher
          <code>expect(a).not.toBe(b)</code>, where if a is equivalent to b, the
          test case fails. There will be other logic inside the test case other
          than the matcher of course, including performing mocks, calculating
          values, pulling data from a database, etc. Below is an example of a
          test case for values that were pulled from a database. We will go over
          the terminology after.
        </p>
        <pre>
    <code class="code">
      test("should output user data", () => {
        // jest.fn() creates a mock of a getData function 
        const mockData = jest.fn(() => 
            {username: "src2012", email: "srasku@email.com", bio: "I like dogs and coding!"}) 
        const successStatus = updateUser(mockData);
        expect(successStatus).toBe(true); 
      })
    </code>
        </pre>
        <p class="text">
          Above, we can see that a new unit test is created using the keyword
          <code>test</code>. Then, we give a description of the unit test, and
          provide an anonymous function that executes the test itself. Inside
          the function, we come across a function called jest.fn(). This is
          creating a mock function, which we control the output of. The mockData
          function is a mock of a function that exists in the actual source code
          that this pretend test case would be testing. The function we are
          testing with this test case is called updateUser, which takes in an
          object with 3 fields and does some logic inside that should return a
          success status. If it doesn't, we know that something in that function
          is broken. Say instead of passing in the email value, we passed in
          <code>undefined</code>. This would create a problem, since every user
          must have an email associated with their account. The unit test we
          just wrote helps take care of this issue. Running the unit test would
          pinpoint exactly where in the code our issue resides and what we need
          to do to fix it. If we wanted expanded capabilities on our unit test,
          we could replace the <code>jest.fn()</code> call with
          <code>jest.spyOn()</code>. Spies are very similar to mocks, but all
          calls to the spied function are tracked. This makes sure the function
          has been called the proper amount of times and the function was called
          with the right arguments. The last thing I want to cover about unit
          testing and Jest is setup and teardown. Setup is code that is run
          before each test. This could include starting a server, populating a
          database with fresh data, or creating an object for the tests to work
          on. Teardown is the opposite, so depopulating an array, stopping a
          server, etc. It is important that these are implemented, because else
          tests will not be working with fresh data, and there is a high
          likelihood that there will be bugs within the test cases themselves.
          Setup is done using the <code>beforeEach()</code> function and
          teardown is done with the <code>afterEach()</code> function. Let's
          take the above example, and add these methods in.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code class="code">
            beforeEach(() => {
              //create database and add sample data
            })
            afterEach(() => {
              //clear database
            })
            test("should output user data", () => {
              // jest.fn() creates a mock of a getData function 
              const mockData = jest.fn(() => 
                  {username: "src2012", email: "srasku@email.com", bio: "I like dogs and coding!"}) 
              const successStatus = updateUser(mockData);
              expect(successStatus).toBe(true); 
            })
          </code>
              </pre>
        <p class="text">
          We can see that the setup and teardown are pretty simple, they just
          take an anonymous function and Jest does all the work of running
          before each test for us. Test cases are a vital part of being an
          effective developer, and is a skill you will take with you to any job
          you go to. The most difficult part about unit tests is figuring out
          all the different corner cases for the function you just built.
          However, the more you do it, the better you'll get, and practice makes
          permanent. Next, we will go over integration testing, which expands
          upon unit tests to ensure components are working together seamlessly.
        </p>
        <h2>Integration Tests</h2>
        <p class="text">
          While unit tests test individual components separately, integration
          tests combines different components that depend on each other, and
          ensure that they work together without error. If in a UI, a table
          needed to be updated based on what was being displayed on screen, we
          have a dependency. If both components worked fine on their own, but
          there were still errors, how would we know that the errors were coming
          from this dependency? Integration tests are testing the relationship
          between these different components to ensure that data is being passed
          correctly between them, and the receiving component is processing it
          correctly. In the above example, say the display text is being fetched
          from a server. We'd write a test to ensure that the data coming
          through is formatted correctly, and a second to ensure the table is
          getting the data correctly from the text component.
          <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The difference between unit and
          integration tests is that unit tests are mocking dependencies.
          Integration tests use the real dependencies to make sure they work in
          production. Next, we will talk about End to End testing, which is
          separate from unit testing and integration testing, but is a much more
          in depth and thorough test process.
        </p>
        <h2>End to End Testing</h2>
        <p class="text">
          End to end testing is the most in depth of the testing methods we've
          discussed. It takes integration testing, which still is only working
          on component dependencies, and expands it to include the entire
          application. Tests are run to ensure that the application is ready for
          production 100%, and there will be no bugs with the app once users
          begin to use it. End to end testing will cover networking, databases,
          third party integrations, and more. It can take hours to finish in
          some cases, and can be run automatically or manually depending on
          which method would be more appropriate for the application being
          tested. For more information on what end to end testing is and how it
          works, be sure to check out the resources section at the bottom.
