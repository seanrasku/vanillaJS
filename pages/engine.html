        <h1>The JavaScript Engine</h1>
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p class="text">
          In this section, we will cover what the JavaScript engine is and how
          it works behind the scenes to make JavaScript work the way it does. We
          start with the <em>call stack</em>, then cover the
          <em>memory heap</em>, and finally, go over how the engine handles
          <em>garbage collection</em>. Let's get started!
        </p>
        <h2>The JavaScript Call Stack</h2>
        <p class="text">
          The call stack in JavaScript is something any JavaScript developer
          should at least be familiar with, and understand how it works at a
          basic level. The call stack is the data structure behind how a program
          is executed in JavaScript, organizing the program in the order it is
          supposed to execute. Say you have this in a JavaScript file:
        </p>
        <pre>
<code class="code">
  function helloworld() { 
    console.log("Hello World!"); 
  } 
  function hellojs() {
    const firstname = "Sean";
    const lastname = "Rasku-Casas";
    console.log(`My name is ${firstname} ${lastname}!`);
    helloworld(); 
  }
  function main() { 
    console.log("main()") 
    hellojs(); 
  } 
  main();
</code>
        </pre>
        <p class="text">

        </p>
        <div class="reveal-container">
          <button class="cover-button" onclick="revealSync1()">
            Click To Reveal!
          </button>
          <pre id="reveal-sync-1" class="reveal-text">
main()
My name is Sean Rasku-Casas!
Hello World!
          </pre>
        </div>
        <script>
          function revealSync1() {
            const display =
              document.getElementById("reveal-sync-1").style.display;
            if (display == "none") {
              document.getElementById("reveal-sync-1").style.display = "flex";
            } else {
              document.getElementById("reveal-sync-1").style.display = "none";
            }
          }
        </script>
        <p class="text">
          In this program, JavaScript will notice a function call at the bottom
          for <code>main()</code>. It will then place the
          <code>main()</code> function on the call stack and execute it. Inside
          <code>main()</code>, the <code>console.log()</code> prints "main()",
          and the program moves to the next line, where there is a function
          call. Next, the <code>hellojs()</code> function is placed on the call
          stack. Inside this function, we see a variable declaration, so it is
          placed on the call stack. Then, we see another variable declaration,
          so it is also placed on the call stack. Right now, our stack looks
          like this (top of the stack being first):
          <span class="stack">lastname -> firstname -> hellojs() -> main()</span
          >. The program continues, and finds a
          <code>console.log()</code> statement. Inside, it needs two values, and
          searches the call stack to find them. Both values are at the top of
          the stack, so the statement is executed and the program moves on,
          finding the <code>helloworld()</code> function on the next line. After
          placing the function on the stack, we now have the following:
          <span class="stack">
            helloworld() -> lastname -> firstname -> hellojs() -> main() </span
          >. The <code>helloworld()</code> function executes, printing "Hello
          World!" to the console, and is removed from the stack, leaving
          <span class="stack"
            >lastname -> firstname -> hellojs() -> main()</span
          >
          on the stack. The <code>hellojs()</code> function has now finished
          executing, so everything up to and including it is also removed. Now,
          only the <code>main()</code> function remains on the stack, and since
          there is nothing left to be executed inside the function, the call
          stack removes it and the program finishes. This is a high level
          explanation of how the call stack works. There are many optimizations
          that can be done to improve the performance of the call stack, and I
          encourage you to look into this if you are interested.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          What we just went through is called <strong>synchronous</strong> code.
          This means that we execute one function at a time, and must wait for
          that function to finish before executing a second one. In other words,
          <code>main()</code> cannot finish until all functions inside it have
          been executed completely. <strong>Asynchronous</strong> code is the
          opposite, where we can execute multiple functions simultaneously, like
          fetching data from a database while keeping the UI rendered.
          JavaScript is synchronous by nature, but can be manipulated to behave
          asynchronously, and we will discover how this is done later on. The
          call stack is the backbone of the JavaScript engine, and is
          instrumental in keeping a program in order, as well as determining
          where the program is during execution. So far, we have only seen
          primitives and basic function calls on the call stack, but there is
          much more that could appear. This is where the JavaScript heap comes
          in, and we'll get into that next!
        </p>
        <h2>The JavaScript Memory Heap</h2>
        <p class="text">
          The JavaScript heap is where we keep the program memory. This area is
          not for keeping track of program execution, but instead is a storage
          area for <strong>reference types</strong> (types that do not have a
          fixed size). Function definitions, arrays, and all other objects are
          reference types. Reference types are given a memory address in the
          heap, and values are fetched from the heap with that address. If an
          object is an array, it will need more than one memory address though,
          because it can keep expanding, and have multiple primitive or
          non-primitive entries. The heap takes note of the address of the first
          entry in the array, and future entries are placed next to the previous
          entry, with the end of the array being the last non-null entry.
          Imagine now that the program above did not have 2 variables, but
          instead an object that contained <code>firstname</code> and
          <code>lastname</code> properties. How can the stack know where in the
          heap to retrieve the object from? This is where
          <strong>pointers</strong> come in. Pointers are given the value of the
          address in memory where the object is located, so when the call stack
          comes upon that object, it knows exactly where to look. If we had the
          object
          <code>const sean = {firstname: "Sean", lastname: "Rasku-Casas"}</code>
          instead of the variable declarations, we would not see the stack being
          <span class="stack">lastname -> firstname -> hellojs() -> main()</span
          >, but instead
          <span class="stack">sean=0x000000 -> hellojs() -> main()</span>, where
          the hex is an example memory address. Each property would also have
          its own address, which would be easily accessible once the call stack
          knows where the object itself is. The final piece of the JavaScript
          engine is garbage collection. Let's get into it!
        </p>
        <h2>Garbage Collection in JavaScript</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Garbage collection is extremely important in any programming language
          that manages its own memory. In JavaScript, the garbage collection
          algorithm used is called the
          <strong>mark-and-sweep</strong> algorithm. This algorithm uses a
          concept called <em>reachability</em> to figure out what is being used
          and what can be discarded. The steps of this algorithm are as follows:
        </p>
        <ol start="0">
          <li class="text">
            First of all, everything currently on the call stack cannot be
            deleted. All functions, their local variables and parameters, and
            any global variables are considered <em>reachable</em>, because they
            are actively being used (or are part of a nested function call). Now
            the algorithm can really start:
          </li>
          <li class="text">
            Mark the <strong>roots</strong> of the program (Everything in step
            0).
          </li>
          <li class="text">
            Mark all references from the roots (e.g. what properties, variables,
            etc. do these objects have?) These references are now also
            considered reachable.
          </li>
          <li class="text">
            Mark all references' references, and any reference that was already
            marked will not be marked again.
          </li>
          <li class="text">
            Loop step 3 until there are no more possible objects to be marked.
          </li>
          <li class="text">Any object that is not marked is removed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="text">
          In addition, anything that is not on the call stack currently is also
          discarded from memory. The last part of garbage collection we will
          cover is the concept of <em>incoming</em> vs
          <em>outgoing</em> references. Incoming references are the only
          references that will make an object reachable, because that reference
          is coming from a an object that must also be reachable. Outgoing
          references only confirm that another object is reachable from the
          current object that the algorithm is on. Take this as an example:
        </p>
        <img
          src="../img/reference_diagram.png"
          alt="Diagram showing incoming and outgoing references for a school and its classes"
          height="500px"
          width="1000px"
          style="align-self: center"
        />
        <p class="text">
          Now, looking at this diagram, we see <code>Classes</code> is the root
          object. <code>Classes</code> contains 2 properties,
          <code>Math</code> and <code>CS</code>, which are used to group the
          classes by what they teach. There are also 2 references to the same
          object: <code>CS220</code>. What do you think happens if we remove the
          <code>CS</code> property from the <code>Classes</code> object? Both
          objects will still be there, but only <code>CS220</code> will still be
          reachable, because it is also in the <code>Math</code> array. By
          looking at the incoming references, we can tell that
          <code>CS110</code> will no be longer reachable from any object, but
          <code>CS220</code> will still have a reference from
          <code>Classes.Math</code>. Therefore, the garbage collector knows that
          it can safely remove <code>CS110</code> from memory and nothing will
          break. That's all for this section, I hope you learned a lot about how
          the JavaScript engine works behind the scenes. See you in the next
          section!
