        <h1>Event Handlers</h1>
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p class="text">
          One reason why JavaScript is such a flexible language due to its
          ability to update and rerender multiple components at the same time.
          This is done with <strong>Event Handlers</strong>, which signal the UI
          that something changed in the browser, and it needs to rerender. This
          is a super important topic in JavaScript, so we will go very in depth
          on this one! In general, there are 2 ways we can register an event
          handler. The first is by using the element's <em>onevent</em> property
          (such as <em>onclick</em>, <em>onfocus</em>, <em>onmousedown</em>, or
          <em>onsubmit</em>), and the second is by using an event listener. In
          both cases, the event handler will receive an
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event"
            target="_blank"
            >Event</a
          >
          object, and will use methods attached to the object to create
          something like a button push, toggle, or some other interactive
          display. The difference between the two ways is that event listeners
          are much more flexible, and are highly recommended over the onevent
          property. Event listeners can be added and removed with simple
          commands, and multiple listeners can be assigned to a single DOM
          element. Now that we've gotten the intro out of the way, let's talk
          about the <em>onevent</em> property first, and then get into
          <em>event listeners </em> after.
        </p>
        <h2>Onevent Properties</h2>
        <p class="text">
          There are many different onevent properties that we could go through,
          but we will cover the areas that they all have in common. Onevent
          properties are a kind of element property, and are specific to that
          element. An onevent property can be used only once on an element,
          which is a little disadvantageous, because the whole point of a
          reactive UI is to be able to have multiple elements reacting to user
          interaction at the same time. Only allowing a single onevent property
          will create very messy code in the end, and limits our ability to
          restructure our code if we want to change the functionality of a
          different element that depends on the current one. Say for example we
          wanted to check out on a button push for an ecommerce site. Maybe we
          also want to display a message saying "Get 50% Off With Another $15.00
          in Purchases!" We also want to display a "Go Back" button and a
          countdown that will redirect the user when it hits 0. Using the
          onevent property, we'd need to keep track of the number of products,
          get the right element in the DOM, and redirect the user either to the
          cart or to the products page after the countdown hits 0 all in one
          event handler, which could get very messy. If we had more than one
          event handler, we could separate these out and give each one its own
          responsibility. This also makes bugs easier to find and allows us to
          expand upon our implementation without having to worry as much about
          how our code is already structured. We will go into how this is done
          in the next section. Open up the <em>inspect</em> tool and navigate to
          the <em>script</em> tag with the code for the
          <code>Check Out</code> button. Inside is the code using event
          listeners instead of the onevent property. Let's now dive into why
          this code is more efficient and cleaner, contrasting it with how an
          implementation might look for an onevent property.
        </p>
        <h2>Event Listeners</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Event listeners are much more flexible than onevent properties. They
          can be added or removed as needed, do not need to be declared in the
          element itself, and more than one can be added to an element at a
          time. Event listeners are declared using the
          <code>addEventListener</code> method. It is called on a DOM element
          that is retrieved inside a JavaScript function. Below is an example of
          how event listeners can help clean up our code. It separates out the
          tasks of a mock checkout system into different handlers, which we
          could expand upon and use for different buttons later if we wanted to
          (although we'd need to change how we retrieve the element to using a
          <code>querySelector</code>, since each element has a unique Id). We
          could also add in new handlers for new UI and we wouldn't have to
          search through a giant function to figure out where everything is
          called. Clearly commented code helps tremendously in this regard, and
          all we would need to do is create a new query and add a listener where
          we need to, making sure that it doesn't break any existing listener
          functionality. Below, we see example code using multiple event
          listeners on a single button. Let's go through and see how it works!
        </p>
        <h3>Example: Check Out</h3>
        <button id="checkout-button" class="tutorial-event-button">
          Check Out &rarr;
        </button>
        <text id="text-to-reveal" class="reveal-text"
          >Get 50% Off With Another $15.00 in Purchases!</text
        >
        <text id="countdown-timer" class="expired-text"></text>
        <button id="go-back-button" class="reveal-button">Go Back Now!</button>
        <script>
          // Get necessary elements from the DOM, in this case the buttons and text to reveal
          const button = document.getElementById("checkout-button");
          const button2 = document.getElementById("go-back-button");
          const text = document.getElementById("text-to-reveal");
          let timeoutId;

          // First event listener listens for a user click and sets the
          // go back button and text displays to visible
          button.addEventListener("click", setFlex);
          function setFlex() {
            button2.style.display = "flex";
            text.style.display = "flex";
          }
          // Next event listener sets a countdown timer for the user to
          // know how much time they have to decide whether to use the
          // coupon. On expiration, the timer shows "EXPIRED" and the go
          // back button and text disappear.
          button.addEventListener("click", () => {
            var countDownDate = new Date().getTime();
            countDownDate = countDownDate - countDownDate + 5;
            var now = 0;
            // Update the count down every 1 second
            var x = setInterval(function () {
              var seconds = countDownDate - now;

              document.getElementById("countdown-timer").innerHTML =
                seconds + " seconds until this deal expires! Check Out Now!";
              console.log(seconds);
              if (seconds < 1) {
                clearInterval(x);
                document.getElementById("countdown-timer").innerHTML =
                  "EXPIRED: Redirecting now...";
                setNone();
              }
              now += 1;
            }, 1000);
          });

          function setNone() {
            button2.style.display = "none";
            text.style.display = "none";
          }

          // Last event listener on the check out button uses the setTimeout
          // function to set a delay on when the navigation to the checkout
          // page happens (Just a function that performs a console.log for now)
          button.addEventListener("click", () => {
            console.log(
              "Timeout function executed, 5 seconds until redirection!"
            );
            timeoutID = setTimeout(goToCheckout, 5000); //setTimeout delays function execution by the number of ms specified
          });
          function goToCheckout() {
            console.log("Navigated to checkout!");
          }

          // Event listener on the go back button listens for a click and
          // "navigates" to the correct page right away. It also needs to cancel
          // setTimeout function called previously, since it won't be used.
          button2.addEventListener("click", () => {
            clearTimeout(timeoutID);
            console.log("Navigated to product listing!");
          });
        </script>
        <p class="text">
          As you can see, the implementation coded using event listeners is very
          clean and concise. We are able to separate out each event listener
          giving each one its respective responsibility, and if a bug crashes
          the program, pinpointing the cause will be much quicker. If we had
          coded it using the onevent property, we would just have one giant
          function, which would not look clean at all. It might still work for
          this example, but with something more complex, and especially if we
          actually implemented routing in our application, it would not be as
          simple. Event listeners help to simplify coding user interaction with
          the website, and using them should always be a priority over the
          onevent property. What's more, if we wanted to remove certain event
          listeners, we can do this using an Abort Controller, which is
          explained in detail under the Mozilla Documentation, and I encourage
          you to take a look at this. In summary, a <code>new</code> controller
          is instantiated at the top, and a signal parameter is passed in to all
          event listeners we want to stop at the same time. When we want to
          abort them, we call the <code>abort()</code> method on the Abort
          Controller, and they will all abort right away. This is another
          advantage over the onevent property, as properties need to be removed
          manually, which is an easy way to make mistakes and is very time
          consuming. That's it for this section, in the next section we will
          learn about promises and async/await. See you then!

/*
              Here lies the crux of the problem. We need a way to hold for a 
              certain period of time to give the user a chance to click the "Go Back 
              button", but this requires a lot of logic. We need to call setTimeout()
              on window.location.replace(url), giving the user around 5 seconds to press the button, 
              and if they haven't, the user would be redirected to the checkout page. During those 5
              seconds, we would need to check if the user clicked "Go Back" with a boolean, set the correct url,
              and update the countdown timer every second. We also need to redirect when the countdown hits 0. 
              Then, the user would be redirected to the correct page. This would be a lot with just the 
              onClick handler, so we won't implement it here, but check out how it would be done below with the 
              .addEventListener() function. The ability to add multiple event listeners to the same UI element 
              really helps clean up the logic and doesn't restrict our ability to separate the function into smaller steps.
