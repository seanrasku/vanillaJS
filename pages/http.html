        <h1>HTTP Requests and the REST API</h1>
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p class="text">
          In this section, we will discuss what a REST API is and how we can use
          HTTP and REST together to send requests. We will then preview
          different technologies we can use to send HTTP requests in vanilla
          JavaScript. Let's get into it!
        </p>
        <h2>What is REST?</h2>
        <p class="text">
          REST is an architectural style that allows for interaction with
          RESTful web services. REST stands for
          <strong>RE</strong>presentational <strong>S</strong>tate
          <strong>T</strong>ransfer, and has certain criteria that APIs need to
          meet before being considered RESTful. The API must have:
        </p>
        <ul class="text">
          <li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
            A client-server architecture with requests managed through HTTP
            (usually, other protocols can be used, but HTTP is most popular).
            The client and server applications are completely independent, with
            the server only able to pass HTTP requests to the client and the
            client only being able to read the URI (uniform resource identifier,
            a lot of times will just be a URL) of what is requested.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
            Stateless client-server communication, meaning the server completes
            each client request independently and each request is isolated from
            other requests.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
            A uniform interface, meaning all API requests for a resource should
            look the same, no matter where the request comes from. Each piece of
            data should be mapped to a unique URI, and must contain all
            information a client might need.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
            A layered system, with servers with different purposes grouped
            together to maximize efficiency. The client is unaware of the
            layered system.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
            The ability for the client to cache responses that will be reused
            multiple times to improve server efficiency.
          </li>
          <li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
            Optional code-on-demand, where servers can extend client
            functionality by sending executable code through HTTP when
            requested.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">
          A Restful API will have a client request and a server response. The
          client request has many parts to it, but we will focus on the most
          popular methods, known as the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
          methods. These 4 methods are
          <em>Get</em> (Read), <em>Post</em> (Create), <em>Put</em> (Update),
          and <em>Delete</em> (Delete). Let's go over each of those now:
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-style: italic">Get</h3>
        <p class="text">
          GET requests are used to retrieve data located on a certain URL.
          Clients can ask the server to filter the data it sends for certain
          parameters as well as cache the data if it will be reused multiple
          times.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-style: italic">Post</h3>
        <p class="text">
          POST requests send new data to the server. This request must include a
          representation of the data being sent so the server can access it and
          execute on it. Sending a POST request multiple times creates the same
          resource multiple times.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-style: italic">Put</h3>
        <p class="text">
          PUT requests update data already on the server. This could be used to
          modify the existing email for a user or creating a new password.
          Sending a PUT request multiple times does not create new instances of
          the data.
        </p>
        <h3 style="font-style: italic">Delete</h3>
        <p class="text">
          DELETE requests remove a resource from the server. They must contain
          proper authentication, and will fail if not supplied.
        </p>
        <h2>HTTP and REST</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Now that we have talked about REST a bit, we should understand how we
          can use REST and HTTP requests together. HTTP is a communication
          protocol while REST is an architectural style. HTTP contains many
          methods that do not conform to the REST architecture, and using these
          will turn an API to being non-RESTful. However, by making sure we use
          the correct methods, we can keep our API stateless and conforming to
          the REST API. This results in a faster application with more security
          built in. For an API to remain RESTful, the client request must
          include a URI, the method for the server to execute on, and HTTP
          headers to provide information, data, and parameters for the server to
          work with. The server response must include a status, a message body
          to display, and headers to provide information back to the client.
          Without all these components, an API cannot be considered RESTful. The
          last piece we will discuss are 2 technologies to use for sending HTTP
          requests to and from the server: <strong>Ajax</strong> and
          <strong>Axios</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2>Ajax and Axios</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Ajax is the traditional way to send data over HTTP. It uses the method
          <code>XMLHTTPRequest()</code> to create a new object, and then
          operates on that object by passing it the method to send to the server
          and the url to operate on. It has a few more steps than Axios, and has
          faded out of style a bit recently, but it is still useful to know how
          it works since Axios is built on top of it. When
          <code>axios.get(url, func)</code>
          is called for example, it is actually using the
          <code>XMLHTTPRequest()</code> method to send the request, with its own
          additional functinality built on top. To see more about these
          technologies, click on the Free Code Camp link below. That's all for
          this lecture, in the next section we will discuss event handlers and
          how to use them to improve code readability and efficiency. See you
          then!
