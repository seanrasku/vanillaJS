        <h1>What is Vanilla JavaScript?</h1>
        <h3>and why is it so important to know?</h3>
        <p class="text">
          Vanilla JavaScript is the core of many frameworks such as React, React
          Native, Node, and Angular. All expand upon JavaScript's capabilities
          to make coding more efficient and easier for the programmer. However,
          relying solely upon these frameworks and not understanding how the
          underlying JavaScript works is not a good idea. Any JavaScript
          developer worth their salt should be able to tell you how event
          handling works in vanilla JavaScript, how HTTP requests are made, and
          the difference between asynchronous and synchronous code. While these
          topics are part of coding in frameworks as well, they are much easier
          to code in React or Angular, and can lead to new or intermediate
          developers not taking the time to understand how JavaScript actually
          performs these tasks behind the scenes, or lead to gaps in knowledge.
          When applying to a company, I was asked by a recruiter what my choice
          of language was, and I answered "React". The recruiter then asked me
          if I knew any vanilla JavaScript, and I told him I had played around
          with it. He explained that if I couldn't understand how JavaScript
          worked in its raw form then he could not consider me for the role
          because I only understood JavaScript at a high level.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          To remedy this, I began to learn vanilla JavaScript and developing
          this website is my final step in becoming proficient in vanilla
          JavaScript. This website is written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and
          CSS, and I explain vanilla JavaScript concepts I believe are
          fundamental to being able to write efficient code. So while you learn,
          I will be reinforcing my knowledge, and we will both be better as a
          result! As a side note, I will not be focusing on the most basic
          topics like what a variable is, types in JavaScript, etc. I will
          instead focus on broader and intermediate/advanced topics, such as
          event handling, asynchronous code, JavaScript prototypes, how the
          JavaScript engine works behind the scenes, and more. I may touch on
          HTML and CSS, but will not go too much in depth. I hope you learn a
          lot, and be sure to check out my GitHub to see other projects I've
          built and to see the code behind this website as well!
