        <h1>Asynchronous vs Synchronous</h1>
        <h2>What is Synchronous Code?</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Before we start on asynchronous code, we need to understand
          synchronous code. We covered a basic definition of synchronous code in
          the <a class="link" href="engine.html">JavaScript Engine</a> section.
          To reiterate, <em>synchronous</em> code is code that is executed one
          step at a time. In other words, two non-nested functions cannot be
          executing simultaneously. An example of synchronous code can be found
          in the above section, but in general, any JavaScript program you write
          will be synchronous unless you apply the techniques we will go over in
          this section. The reasoning behind this is due to the fact that
          JavaScript is a synchronous language by nature. Next, we will go over
          why this is, and some new terminology as well.
        </p>
        <h2>
          The JavaScript Engine Continued: Single-Thread Definition and
          Asynchronous Manipulation
        </h2>
        <h3>What Does Single-Threaded Mean?</h3>
        <p class="text">
          When we discussed the JavaScript engine, we did not cover terminology
          related to asynchronous code. Now, we will get into this terminology,
          starting with threads. JavaScript is a
          <em>single-threaded</em> language. This means that a single thread is
          responsible for executing functions and keeping the program running.
          This also means that 2 functions cannot execute at the same time,
          since there is only a single thread. The term
          <em>single-threaded</em> means there is only a single
          <strong>call stack</strong>, a term which we went over in the previous
          section. Whatever is on the top of the call stack is what is run next,
          and until what is on top of the stack has finished running, the
          application is in a "frozen" state. If we have nested functions in our
          program, then all the previously called functions are also frozen.
          This creates a problem though right? If we can only have a single
          function run at a time, how can we perform a task like fetch data from
          a database while keeping the UI running? The UI itself is constantly
          refreshing, and is listening for any changes made by the user. If we
          send a request to the database, the JavaScript program will make that
          the priority, and the UI will stop working. For example, if we tried
          to send data from this website to a PostgreSQL database synchronously,
          the "Topics" nav button would no longer be clickable. The call stack
          can't push a new function until the previous one has finished
          executing, so nothing would work. To solve this issue, we will now
          look at <strong>asynchronous</strong> code, and how JavaScript gets
          around the single-threaded conundrum.

          Asynchronous Execution: Callback Functions, The Callback Queue, The
          Event Loop, and More!
        </h3>
        <p class="text">
          Asynchronous code is how JavaScript can execute multiple functions at
          the same time, and is what keeps user interfaces looking clean and
          working perfectly. How does it work though? When we talked about the
          JavaScript Engine, we left out a couple parts. The first is the
          <em>callback queue</em>. This is where
          <strong>callback functions</strong> are taken care of. A callback
          function is a function that is passed as an argument to another
          function, and is executed once the first function has finished
          executing. Callback functions are used heavily in promises, which we
          will talk about later. The reason callbacks are asynchronous is
          because of how they work. Callbacks are given to a function with the
          expectation that they will be called later, meaning that they will not
          "freeze" the UI right away like their synchronous counterparts, since
          they are not actually being executed, and thus not on the call stack.
          In the code below, we show synchronous code versus its callback
          counterpart.

        <p class="text">
          In the code above, we have the same thing happening twice. In both
          programs we are making a smoothie. The only difference is in how we
          make it. The first program makes a smoothie sequentially. This means
          it is executing synchronously. The second way uses callbacks, with
          each step being passed into another function as an argument. Once the
          callback functions are called, they are placed in the
          <strong>callback queue</strong>. The callback queue is placed in a
          loop along with the call stack and
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API"
            target="_blank"
            >browser APIs</a
          >
          and when a callback function enters the queue, it will execute once
          the call stack is fully empty. The loop between the call stack,
          callback queue, and browser APIs is known as the
          <strong>Event Loop</strong>, and is extremely important when coding
          asynchronously in JavaScript. Without it, only synchronous code would
          be able to be run. In general, callbacks are not really used in
          practice anymore due to something called <em>callback hell</em>, but
          are still very important to understand. If you look at the callback
          code above, you can see how deeply nested it is, and how something
          like this would be very hard to debug. If we had a large program that
          needed a much greater amount of callbacks, this could turn really ugly
          really quick. To solve this, <em>promises</em> were introduced in ES6,
          and we will go over those in section 7. That's it for this section, I
          hope you learned a lot about how synchronous and asynchronous code
          differ. In the next few sections, we will go over areas of JavaScript
          where it is best to use asynchronous code. We will start with HTTP
          Requests, then move on to Event Handlers, and finish with Promises and
          async/await. See you then!
