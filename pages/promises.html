        <h1>Promises and async/await</h1>
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p class="text">
          We've covered a lot so far, but for our last major concept on how
          vanilla JavaScript works, we are going to talk about one that ties a
          lot of past concepts together. Promises are an extremely important
          part of ES6, and are widely used now over past methods like the
          regular callback functions we discussed in section 4. Let's get into
          that first, and then we'll tie in async/await after.
        </p>
        <h2>Promises</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Promises are a form of asynchronous programming. They are very similar
          to callback functions, but have a few key differences. The first is
          that promises are <strong>returned objects</strong> while callbacks
          are just regular functions. The issue with callback functions is in
          the event that we have a large complex problem, we may need many
          callback functions, and this creates <em>callback hell</em>. Since
          promises are a returned object, they can take in parameters, and this
          helps, because we can pass in callback functions as those parameters.
          Therefore, the nested functions we saw in section 4 can be rewritten
          to look like this:
        </p>
        <pre>
  <code class="code">
      function addMilk(smoothie, milkType) {
        smoothie.milk = milkType;
        return smoothie;
      }
      function addFruits(smoothie, fruit1, fruit2) {
        smoothie.fruit1 = fruit1;
        smoothie.fruit2 = fruit2;
        return smoothie;
      }
      function blend(smoothie) {
        smoothie.blendedSmoothie = smoothie.fruit1 + " " + smoothie.fruit2;
        return smoothie;
      }
      function makeSmoothie() {
          let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
              resolve({milk: undefined, fruit1: undefined, fruit2: undefined, blendedSmoothie: undefined})
          })
          promise
          .then((raw) => addMilk(raw, "Almond"))
          .then((withMilk) => addFruits(withMilk, "Banana", "Strawberry"))
          .then((unblended) => blend(unblended))
          .then((blended) => console.log(`Final Smoothie: ${blended.blendedSmoothie}`))
          .catch((err) => console.error(err));
      }
    Rewrite code here after fixing section 4, cover when to use .then, (thenable vs non-thenable)
  </code>
</pre>
        <p class="text">
          As can be seen, the first 3 functions really don't change that much.
          The only difference is we are removing the callback from the function,
          because the promise will handle that for us. They are still being
          treated like callbacks, but the <code>.then</code> function is
          allowing us to remove the nested style and make it cleaner to look at.
          This means that while it doesn't look like we are passing a callback
          function, we actually are. Now that we covered what promises look
          like, let's do a deep dive into how they work. The definition of a
          <strong>promise</strong> (from the Mozilla docs) is an object that
          represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous
          operation and its returned value. In other words, a promise is holding
          a value until the function inside it has finished executing, and uses
          either <code>resolve()</code> or <code>reject()</code> to pass the
          value or an error to the <code>.this</code> function. A promise is
          always in one of three states: <em>pending</em>, meaning it is neither
          fulfilled or rejected, <em>fulfilled</em>, meaning the promise was
          resolved successfully, or <code>rejected</code>, meaning there is
          something wrong with the code and the promise returned an error. When
          the promise changes from <code>pending</code> to another state, it'll
          either pass the returned value to the <code>.then</code> method or the
          error will be caught with <code>.catch</code>. If there are more
          <code>.then</code> methods, the state of the promise is reset to
          <em>pending</em> and the process starts all over again.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Promises are used almost everywhere nowadays. They can be in this
          format or use the <code>await</code> keyword as discussed below. In
          general, the most important part of promises you should understand is
          that promises are holding functions until they complete in the
          background. If we are passing callbacks and the promise has multiple
          steps, the we will pass function return values between its
          <code>.then</code> methods until the promise is resolved completely.
          That's all for promises, let's move on to async/await now, and see how
          promises can be shortened and look even cleaner than they do now!
        </p>
        <h2>async/await</h2>
        <p class="text">
          We have already covered async functions extensively, and we are now
          going to cover one last bit of important information, and that is the
          <code>await</code> keyword. As we know, async functions return a
          promise,and we can access the result of that promise using
          <code>.then</code>. The <code>await</code> keyword is a shortcut for
          all of this. If we have the promise declared above, instead of using
          <code>.then(...)</code>, we can just use <code>await promise</code>,
          and it does the same thing! The <code>await</code> keyword is making
          JavaScript wait until the promise is resolved, and then will return
          its result, which we can store in a variable and use later. This is
          especially important in web service calls (like fetch()), and is used
          widely with JavaScript libraries like Axios. If we did a
          <code>GET</code> request in axios without using the
          <code>await</code> keyword, it would look something like this:
        </p>
        <pre class="text">
          <code>const data = axios.get(url).then(...).catch(...); (kind of long)</code>

Now, if we use the <code>await</code> keyword with axios:

          <code>const data = await axios.get(url); (Much shorter, and returns the resolved promise as well)</code>
        </pre>
        <p class="text">
          There are some considerations to take into account however, the first
          being that you should always have a check after the
          <code>await</code> keyword to ensure it returned correctly. You can do
          this using a <code>try catch</code> block. The second is
          <strong>you can only use this keyword inside async functions</strong>.
          You will get an error if you try to use it inside a synchronous
          function, and that is because the entire point of the keyword is to
          work with promises. It also must be used inside a module. It cannot be
          used globally, since JavaScript is synchronous. The last thing I want
          to cover about the <code>await</code> keyword is that it accepts
          "thenables", which is an object with a <code>then()</code> function.
          This is different, because the object does not need to be a promise.
          If <code>await</code> receives a non-promise object that has the
          <code>.then</code> function, <code>await</code> will call the method
          using <code>resolve</code> and <code>reject</code> as arguments. Once
          one of the methods are called, <code>await</code> will take the result
          and proceed as it normally does. This is important, because it means
          that <code>await</code> is not just limited to ES6, but can be used
          with some legacy code as well. There is much more to the await
          keyword, and I encourage you to look into it by going through the
          references section. That's all for this section, I hope you learned a
          lot, let's move on to the last section!
