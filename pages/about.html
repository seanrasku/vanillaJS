          Sean Rasku-Casas is a Computer Science Graduate from the University of
          Massachusetts Boston. He specializes in front end work using React.js,
          React Native, and Swift, but also has worked on the back end of
          several web applications in Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and SQL.
          Over 4 years, he has worked on multiple projects, including building a
          website for matching investors with prospective companies using
          React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, and creating a password
          manager using Swift and Apple CryptoKit. Sean has also interned for
          Nuance Communications, building unit tests using Spring Boot, Mockito,
          and JUnit. Unit tests are very important, and Sean managed to increase
          code coverage by over 60%. Recently, Sean has turned his focus to
          blockchain and learning how to build dApps using Solidity, Ethers.js,
          and React.js. Sean then plans to use the knowledge he acquires to
          build and deploy production level applications. Follow him on LinkedIn
          and check out his GitHub to view some of his past projects and for the
          code that built this website as well!
